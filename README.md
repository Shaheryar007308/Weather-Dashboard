# Real-Time Weather Dashboard

A responsive weather dashboard that fetches and displays real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API.

This project was built as part of a frontend development task to practice working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive UI design.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Weather Dashboard allows users to:

- Search for weather in multiple cities
- View current temperature and weather conditions
